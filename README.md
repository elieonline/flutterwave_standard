## About
This package streamlines Flutterwave's [Standard](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/flutterwave-standard) payment integration into your Flutter app. Built upon Flutterwave's official Flutter SDK, it eliminates extra screens and confirmation dialogs, automatically initiating payments for a smoother user experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  
See [references](#references) for links to dashboard and API documentation.

## Requirements
- Ensure you have your test (and live) [API keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/api-keys).   
  ``` Flutter version >= 1.17.0 Flutterwave version 3 API keys ```

## Installation Add the dependency

In your `pubspec.yaml` file add:

1. `flutterwave_standard_auto: ^1.0.0`
2. run `flutter pub get`  
   <a id="usage"></a>

## Usage

Create a `Flutterwave` instance by calling the constructor `Flutterwave` The constructor accepts a mandatory instance of the following:  
the calling `Context` , `publicKey`, `Customer`, `amount`, `currency`, `email`, `fullName` and `txRef` . It returns an instance of `Flutterwave` which we then call the `async` method `.charge()` on.

    _handlePaymentInitialization() async { 
    final Customer customer = Customer(
		    name: "FLW Developer", 
		    phoneNumber: "1234566677777", 
		    email: "customer@customer.com"
		    );  
		    
    final Flutterwave flutterwave = Flutterwave(
		    context: context, 
		    publicKey: "Public Key, 
		    currency: "RWF", 
		    redirectUrl: "my_redirect_url" 
		    txRef: "unique_transaction_reference", 
		    amount: "3000", 
		    customer: customer, 
		    paymentOptions: "ussd, card, barter, payattitude", 
		    isDebug: true
		    ); 
		} 

### 2. Handle the response

Calling the `.charge()` method returns a `Future`  
of `ChargeResponse` which we await for the actual response as seen above.



     final ChargeResponse response = await flutterwave.charge(); 
     if (response != null) { 
	     print(response.toJson()); 
		 if(response.success) { 
		 Call the verify transaction endpoint with the transactionID returned in `response.transactionId` to verify transaction before offering value to customer 
		 } else { 
		  // Transaction not successful 
		} 
	 } else {
	  // User cancelled 
	 }

#### Please note that:
- `ChargeResponse` can be null, depending on if the user cancels  
  the transaction by pressing back.
- You need to check the status of the transaction from the instance of `ChargeResponse` returned from calling `.charge()`, the `status`, `success` and `txRef` are successful and correct before providing value to the customer

>  **PLEASE NOTE**

> We advise you to do a further verification of transaction's details on your server to be sure everything checks out before providing service.
